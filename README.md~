## Abstract:
### A randomised controlled trial of chemotherapy agent “A” as a treatment for advanced gastrointestinal cancer

*Background*:    
the prognosis of patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is poor.
The chemotherapy agent “A” is already a part of the treatment for other types of cancers.
However, its effect on survival or quality of life has not been investigated for advanced GI cancer patients.
*Aim*:  
to explore the effect of chemotherapy agent “A” on survival and quality of life of advanced GI cancer patients.
*Method*:  
patients with advanced GI cancer were recruited to the study and randomised into either a treatment group who received chemotherapy agent "A" in addition to palliative care, or a control group who received only palliative care (n=34, n=32 respectively).
Survival was measured in months starting from inclusion in the trial.
Quality of life was measured on the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale before treatment and at a follow-up three months after.
The code for the statistics and figures can be found [here](./stats/QoL.ipynb)
*Results*:  
The survival of the treatment group (median of 8 months) was significantly prolonged (p<0.01) compared with the control group (median of 4.5 months). 
There was no significant difference in quality of life as measured in global health scores (p=0.139). 
Additionally, the treatment group had slightly higher scores for nausea, pain and dyspnoea tha the control group but these differences were not significant (p=0.858, p=0.201, p=0.182, respectively).  
*Conclusion*:
Chemotherapy agent "A" prolonged survival time for advanced GI cancer patients while not significantly affecting their quality of life.
